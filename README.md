# Cheese Map

Welcome to Cheese Map!  
by [Hapaxia](http://github.com/Hapaxia)

Cheese Map is a drawable layered tile map for SFML, designed to simplify drawing most 2D maps.

It's also fully header-only so no library compilation needed; simply just include it (Map).




# Note
Cheese Map requires SFML.
> It's designed for the current and latest release (2.6) and has not yet been tested with SFML 3.
